# Multi-Agent Research System - Summary

## What We've Built

We've created a complete Multi-Agent Research System in Python that can:

1. Take a broad research query as input
2. Decompose it into focused sub-queries
3. Collect relevant information from web sources
4. Synthesize the information into a structured format
5. Generate a professional PDF report

## System Architecture

The system consists of four specialized agents:

1. **QueryProcessor**: Uses LLM to decompose broad queries into specific sub-queries
2. **DataCollector**: Scrapes web sources for information on each sub-query
3. **ContentAnalyzer**: Synthesizes collected data using LLM into coherent sections
4. **ReportGenerator**: Creates a formatted PDF report from the synthesized content

## How to Use

### Basic Usage (without API key)
1. Run the system with any research query:
   ```
   python main.py "Your research topic here"
   ```
2. The system will use fallback methods to generate a report

### Full Functionality (with API key)
1. Get a free API key from https://console.groq.com/
2. Add it to your `.env` file:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
3. Run the system:
   ```
   python main.py "Your research topic here"
   ```

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Each agent can be enhanced or replaced independently
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Gracefully degrades when API is not available
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout the pipeline
- **Configurable**: Easy to adjust parameters for different use cases
- **Extensible**: Can be extended with additional agents or features

## Output

The system generates:
- A professionally formatted PDF report in the `reports/` directory
- A JSON file with the synthesized content for further processing

## Technical Stack

- **LLM**: Groq API (Llama 3)
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup and requests
- **PDF Generation**: ReportLab
- **Environment Management**: python-dotenv

## Next Steps for Enhancement

1. Improve web scraping with more sophisticated techniques
2. Add support for more output formats (Word, HTML)
3. Implement a web interface for easier interaction
4. Add citation formatting and reference management
5. Enhance the LLM prompts for better results
6. Add multi-language support
